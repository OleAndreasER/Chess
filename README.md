# chess
Unfinished command line chess game.

Features missing are en passant, castling, promotions and checking.  
I made this because I had the idea of describing the pieces' movement rules using slopes and ranges:  
 - a bishop has infinite range, and can move with slope 1 and -1;  
 - a knight has a range of 1, and can move with slope 0.5, -0.5, 2 and -2;  
 - the king has a range of 1, and can move with slope 0, inf, 1 and -1.
